A SIP scanner written in Golang, inspired by SIPvicious. It can enumerate SIP servers over UDP, TCP and TLS.

At least, that's the goal. This is very much a work in progress and is currently not ready for general use. You have been warned!

- Final tool will support UDP, TCP and TLS.
- Use sipp to test TCP?
- Final tool will include support for mapping CIDR ranges or an input file.
